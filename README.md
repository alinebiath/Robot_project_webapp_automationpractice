# Automated tests for web app with Robot Framework.
Small demonstration of a project to automate web application tests with Robot Framework.

Robot Framework is a Python-based, extensible keyword-driven test automation framework for end-to-end acceptance testing and acceptance-test-driven development (ATDD). Read more: http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html

Some advantages of the Robot Framework are the ability to create tests for any plataform and the use of the various availables libraries to produce tests to any type applications.

In this model I'm automating acceptance tests, using scenarios written in BDD and the Selenium library to interact with the browser.
Some others libraries were used to support the tests.
